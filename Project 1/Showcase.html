    <h3>State Farm work:</h3>
    <p>I worked for 2 and a half years for StateFarm as an intern and did a lot of work regarding making sandboxes for node.js so that others could do work without anything reflecting on the production state. I also did a number of automations within the cisco phone network for agents sending in requests. Some other smaller things i helped with was 3d modeling to make augmented reality things.</p>

    <h3>Endless Code:</h3>
    <p>I have worked on an idea as well for later continuation regarding helping learn code and getting people more engaged in coding as a whole. I came up with this project last year as a result of a class i was taking and since then it has been something i work on in the background.</p>
