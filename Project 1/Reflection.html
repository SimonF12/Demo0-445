<h2>Reflection:</h2>
<p>I have learned a lot over my years at bradley as a CIS major and all the other various things i do and am apart of. I have had the pleasure of being apart of Delta Tau Delta a frat here at Bradley which has given me many oppurtunities to do exciting things.</p>
<hr style="color: purple;">
<p>I have had many opportunities because of delts and because of that i am very thankful that i had the ability to have those chances. While i reflect many of the good times i've had with people from my frat are uncountable and hold a dear place with me.</p>
